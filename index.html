                    Hello there, my name is Eric Bishop, welcome to my website!! Pardon the construction 
                    I'm pretty new to this whole web development thing. I am hoping in the near future
                    this site will be quite rad! So far I'm really enjoying the challenge that this
                    class provides. I've put in quite a few hours trying to get this site to look as
                    awesome as it does; so TA's, please grade kindly! In all seriousness, I'm pretty 
                    proud that I got this thing to look as good as it does. There are a few issues
                    that i didn't quite figure out, but through hardwork I solved a lot of my own issues.
                </p>

                This is that awkward part where I try to describe myself. Truth is, I'm pretty
                cool. I love the mountains anytime of year; if I'm not sliding down them in the 
                winter I'm hiking up them when its warm. I'm really into music and music theory,
                however, I don't play an instrument. I'm also way into cars and used to own a pretty 
                cool Porsche. I have a way awesome girlfriend named Katie; she's going to wonder why
                it took me so long to bring her up. Trust me she's way cooler than me, I should have 
                made this website about her. Last thing to bring up is my dog Bandit. He's a total riot
                to have around and makes every day better.
